<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a Ph.D. student in SIGMA Lab from the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, supervised by Professor [Yanwei Yu](https://yuyanwei.github.io/).

My research interest includes Graph Neural Network and Data Mining. I have published 10+ papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4tUWtNAAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4tUWtNAAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
